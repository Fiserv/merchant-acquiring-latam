At the acquirer business, field services providers play an important role to enable business to run, by deploying new terminals, paper rolls, providing maintenance to broken terminals, exchanging SimCards carriers and removing equipmentâ€™s from merchants whenever required. To trigger a service order to an appropriate field services provider Fiserv made available a set of APIs, described at this document, which will be divided in two main sections, being the first one dedicated for the financial institutions to provide merchant support and the second part designed to assist a new service provider when integrating with Fiserv.
