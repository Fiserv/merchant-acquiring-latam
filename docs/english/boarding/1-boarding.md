## Latam Merchant Boarding APIs

The merchant boarding solution is a key prerequisite for transaction processing. Before merchants can perform any transaction they must be onboarded. The onboarding process means creating records in Fiserv systems and activating desired services and equipment. It also can include an approval process. As a result of the onboarding process, the merchant and the activated equipment will be ready for transaction processing and the funds can be transferred to their bank account.

There are multiple components involved in transaction processing. The image below shows a simplified end-to-end process of boarding new merchants:
