# New Merchant Boarding Steps

When the offers have been configured, the following are the steps of the journey to getting your merchant boarded. Further details can be found on the subsequent pages:

## 1. Get available offerings

All available offerings are retrieved in order to select the desired one. The search can be filtered based on criteria provided. More details can be found in the List Available Offerings page.

## 2. Retrieve details of the selected offering

When the best offering (or combination) is identified more details need to be retrieved that later in the process are added to the merchant boarding request. Those details determine which service and equipment need to be activated along with the pricing information. More details on the following pages:

1. Retrieve Acquiring Offerings
1. Retrieve Posting Accounts
1. Retrieve Equipment Offerings

## 3. Collect Merchant Details

All necessary information about the merchant is captured in this step. Follow the step by step guide in order to construct the payload of an API request to submit a merchant for boarding.

## 4. Submit

When all necessary information has been collected an API call (merchant boarding request) can be submitted to the /orders/new-merchant endpoint.
