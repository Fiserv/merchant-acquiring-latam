## Latam Merchant Logistics APIs

At the acquirer business, field services are essential for enabling businesses to operate. They deploy new terminals, provide maintenance for broken terminals, deliver paper rolls, exchange SIM cards, and remove equipment from merchants when necessary. To facilitate service orders to the right field services provider, Fiserv has developed a set of APIs outlined in this document. These APIs are divided into two main sections: the first one is intended for financial institutions and acquirers providing merchant support, while the second is designed to assist new service providers when integrating with Fiserv.
